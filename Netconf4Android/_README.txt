
Netconf4android - The Java/Android library for Netconf applications
===================================================================

http://giuseppe-palmeri.github.io/netconf4android/

This is an API that implements the netconf protocol (RFC 4741) for
building client applications.

The netconf protocol is designed for managing network devices.
It uses an RPC paradigm to perform configuration actions and
management of remote devices.

The main goal is to provide valuable support for this protocol
for Android applications and java applications. 
With this API and any netconf server that supports certain
capabilities, you can build an Android application to configure
and drive a remote firewall for example.
