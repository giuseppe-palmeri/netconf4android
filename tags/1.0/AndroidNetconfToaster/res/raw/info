This application is the implementation of the Netconf toaster.

It was developed as a real example of using the Java/Android Netconf4Android API designed by Giuseppe Palmeri.

Netconf4Android is an API that implements the Netconf protocol (RFC4741) for building client applications. 

The main goal for this API is to provide valuable support for this protocol for Android applications and java applications.
 
With this API and any Netconf server that supports certain capabilities, you can build an Android application to configure and drive a remote firewall for example.
