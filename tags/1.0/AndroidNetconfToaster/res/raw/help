What is this application?

This application is used to control a toaster present in a TCP/IP network
through the Netconf protocol (RFC4741) over an SSH-2 connection (RFC4742).
It is an example of how to use the Netconf4Android API.


What you need to make it work?

To have to run this example, you must have access to a 
YUMA Server that has the toaster capability:
    
http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster
    
This capability comes from the YANG module toaster.yang:

http://www.netconfcentral.org/modulereport/toaster

Note that this example should be run as superuser on the YUMA server.

The YUMA Server is part of YUMA Tools Project of Andy Bierman at Netconf Central.

What is the Netconf protocol?

The Netconf protocol is a special protocol that arose out of finding a standard for configuring and driving remote devices accessible via a TCP/IP network.

It is based on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests and responses traveling on a common transport protocol such as SSH-2.


How do I develop a Netconf application for Java or Android?

To do this you need the latest version of Netconf4Android.
The project also contains the source code for this application, so
you can have a good point of beginning.
