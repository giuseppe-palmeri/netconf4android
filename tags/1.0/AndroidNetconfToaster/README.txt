
Android Netconf Toaster - An Android Netconf application for make toast.
===================================================================

http://code.google.com/p/netconf4android/w/list

This implementation was produced according to the specific capacity:

    http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster

By Andy Bierman at Netconf Central.

This capability provides new elements for set up and drive a toaster.

To do this, see the documentation that has served the custom
capability at this address:

    http://www.netconfcentral.org/modulereport/toaster

This material was generated through the YANG module that describes
the new capability and providing the basis for a server-side
implementation of it.

More information on what YANG modules and how they are used within
netconf can be found on the website of Netconf Central 
(http://netconfcentral.org) or directly through RFC6020.

To try and test this application you must have
access to a Yuma Server with the YANG module 'toaster' 
pre-loaded from the server.

Yuma Server is part of Yuma Tools, a great netconf Implementation
using YANG modules for the instrumental part of a capability.
