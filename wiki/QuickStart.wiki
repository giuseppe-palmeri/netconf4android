#summary Learn to quickly create an application on Android and Java with Netconf4Android.

==Introduction==

This guide shows how to create a simple application using the API.

Our aim is to implement a simple Java application that controls a toaster through a Netconf server that has this capability:

     http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster

All the features that make the capability to control a toaster is described through the following YANG module:

    [http://www.netconfcentral.org/modulereport/toaster toaster.yang]

Our example, we plan to use a YUMA Server that has the ability to make this capability available in a dynamic way through the LOAD Operation.

To learn how to install the server, please consult the appropriate documentation of the project and in particular, for this example, the following guides:

    [http://www.netconfcentral.org/static/manuals/yuma-installation-guide.pdf Yuma Installation Guide]

    [http://www.netconfcentral.org/static/manuals/yuma-quickstart-guide.pdf Yuma Quickstart Guide]

The home directory of the YUMA Tools project is:

    http://www.netconfcentral.org

Once you have familiarized yourself with the server you can easily access the next step.

Please note that for our example, for simplicity, the user with which you connect must have *superuser privileges* on the YUMA Server.

Only a super user can dynamically load a module and initialize it.

A better version of our example is [http://code.google.com/p/netconf4android/downloads/detail?name=Netconf4Android.zip Android netconf Toaster].

This is an Eclipse project that you can safely explore and from which to take ideas for your applications.
