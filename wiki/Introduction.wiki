#summary netconf4android - Android and Java client API for Netconf applications.

= Introduction =

This is a brief description of the project with some information and references to discover the *new world* of Netconf protocol.

_This will be useful if you want to develop a Netconf application._


= Details =

This project was created with the intention to implement the Netconf protocol (RFC4741) 
to be used primarily on Smartphones such as Android.

The project is 100% Pure Java code and 100% Android (API Level 8) compatible.

The Netconf protocol is a special protocol that arose out of finding a standard for configuring and driving remote devices accessible via a TCP/IP network.

The Netconf protocol is based on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests and responses traveling on a common transport protocol such as SSH-2.


With this library you can implement specific applications that can be exploited
through a Netconf server.

There are specific capabilities through various implementations that are
being prepared to receive RPC calls of various kinds.

Here are some projects more or less advanced
with the knowledge that you have to do to use this library.
