# Netconf4Android
This is an API that implements the Netconf protocol (RFC 4741) for building client applications.

The Netconf protocol is designed for managing network devices.

It uses an RPC paradigm to perform configuration actions and management of remote devices.

The main goal is to provide valuable support for this protocol for Android applications and Java applications.

With this API and any Netconf server that supports certain capabilities, you can build an Android application to configure and drive a remote firewall for example.
